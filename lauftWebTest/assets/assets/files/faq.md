Simply, life can’t throw curves and everyone needs to be able to adapt on the fly. Even when it comes to work. LAUFT is designed to support the best remote work experience possible. We’d love to see workers taking full advantage of our flexible network and touching down at various locations throughout the week, close to home, next to their favourite coffee shop or simply when working from home doesn’t provide the right level of professionalism. By embracing the realities of life we help free remote workers to choose where and when they want to work – every day.
