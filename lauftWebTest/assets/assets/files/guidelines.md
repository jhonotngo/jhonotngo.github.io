# LAUFT Community Guidelines
## PURPOSE
 LAUFT is committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religious affiliation. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. LAUFT users violating these rules may face consequences including, but not limited to, expulsion from the LAUFT network without a refund. By registering with LAUFT, you are agreeing to abide by these guidelines. We expect our community to help us realize a safe and positive experience for everyone.



## WHAT CONSTITUTES HARASSMENT

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
* Verbal comments that reinforce discrimination based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
*  Sexually-charged jokes, statements, or comments.
* Creation or display of sexual images in public spaces.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or unwanted following.
* Harassing photography or video/audio recording.
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events.
* Inappropriate physical contact.
* Invasion of personal space.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

These behaviors, as well as others described below, are not conducive to a welcoming environment and are therefore prohibited from LAUFT.

## ENFORCEMENT
If a user engages in harassing behavior, LAUFT staff retain the right to take action in order to maintain a welcoming environment for other users. This includes warnings, expulsion from the workspace without a refund, or other measures deemed appropriate. LAUFT staff are authorized to address anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, making the environment hostile for any users. We expect users to follow these rules at all workspaces and LAUFT-related social activities, and we encourage users to follow these guidelines outside of LAUFT-sanctioned activities.

## REPORTING
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible. LAUFT staff will be identifiable by their attire or badges, and they will be instructed on how to respond to harassment. All claims are taken seriously and will be handled by LAUFT staff. You can make a report either personally or anonymously, both detailed below.

## ANONYMOUS REPORT

LAUFT will set up an online form to report harassment HERE [include link to form]. We promise to fully investigate and act on information we receive through anonymous reporting.

## PERSONAL REPORT
You can make a personal report by: Contacting a LAUFT staff member, identified by their outfit/badge. Emailing us: makesmartwork @ mylauft .com. Calling us: 1-844-WE-LAUFT

When taking a personal report, our staff will make sure that we discuss your issue privately and securely. They may involve other LAUFT staff to ensure your report is managed properly. At this point, we will ask you to go over the details of the harassment. This can be a difficult process, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you are welcome to bring someone with you for support. We will never ask you to confront someone, and we will not relay your name or information to the accused. Our team will be happy to put you in touch with security, law enforcement, or any other local services you request. We want you to feel safe and comfortable. Your attendance is important to us.


## PHOTO POLICY
All photographers will seek to obtain permission for posting. Users are free to ask that photographs of themselves are withheld from any promotional materials. To maintain privacy and personal boundaries, all LAUFT staff must ask before taking any photographs that are clearly meant to highlight a small group or single person.
## INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE
As language is both a reflection of and a contributor towards culture, we do ask that all users use language that demonstrates the best aspects of coworking culture and avoid language that could alienate or disparage others. This means we ask that you follow these guidelines for what constitutes disrespectful language.
## GENERAL GUIDELINES
There is no place at LAUFT for language that is openly or casually degrading to a person or group. Any words or phrases, no matter how seemingly innocuous, that perpetuate negative stereotypes and communicate exclusion are not allowed. Some of these can be subtle and said without any ill-will, which is why we encourage participants to examine their own language and use this guide as an opportunity for learning. For some examples of language that we are trying to avoid, please see the below examples.
## RACISM
Racism is deeply rooted across societies globally, exists among all social classes, and is connected to a long history of violence, oppression, and domination. Addressing individuals or a group of people in a diminutive, derogative, or malicious way based on their (assumed) race and ethnic background is racist, disrespectful, and harmful. We do not tolerate any racist behavior, slurs, statements, or jokes.
## ABLEISM
Words like “crazy,” “dumb,” “insane,” or “lame” are examples of language that devalues people who have physical or mental disabilities. Many people use these words not because they seek to be hurtful, but because they are attempting to describe something they perceive to be outside of the norm, which reinforces harmful stereotypes and impacts real people. Instead, try to broaden your vocabulary and find ways to express yourself that are more appropriate, inclusive, and elegant.
## SEXISM
We strongly advise avoiding gendered pronouns as well as any gendered terms. Everyone is expected to respect each other’s chosen pronouns.
## MEDIATION
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify LAUFT staff with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with LAUFT’s existing governance policies.
